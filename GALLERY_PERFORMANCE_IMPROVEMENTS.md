# Gallery Performance Improvements

This document explains the optimizations implemented to improve the performance of the gallery page, focusing particularly on image loading and page speed.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Image Preloading from Homepage

- **Strategy**: Load key gallery images while users are on the homepage, but only after the homepage is fully loaded
- **Implementation**: Created `gallery-preloader.js` which intelligently preloads priority images
- **Benefits**: Gallery images are already cached when user navigates to the gallery page

### 2. Progressive Image Loading in Gallery

- **Prioritized visible images**: First images from each collection load immediately
- **Proper image attributes**: Added width, height, fetchpriority, and loading attributes
- **Benefits**: Prevents layout shifts, improves page speed score, and provides better user experience

### 3. Critical CSS Inlining

- **Above-the-fold CSS**: Added critical CSS directly in the gallery.html page header
- **Preloaded stylesheets**: Used `rel="preload"` for important CSS files
- **Benefits**: Faster render times by showing visual content before all CSS is loaded

### 4. Lazy Loading & Image Intersection Observer

- **Intersection Observer**: Created an optimized image loading strategy based on viewport visibility
- **Prioritized currently visible images**: Loads images based on their visibility priority
- **Benefits**: Reduces initial page load time and bandwidth usage

### 5. JavaScript Optimizations

- **Deferred initialization**: Using requestAnimationFrame for non-critical initializations
- **Reduced DOM queries**: Cached DOM selectors and minimized reflows/repaints
- **Image preloading in modal**: Preloads next/previous images for smoother gallery navigation
- **Event debouncing**: Improved scroll and resize event handling

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should significantly improve:

1. **Initial load time**: By prioritizing visible content
2. **Time to Interactive**: By deferring non-critical operations
3. **FID (First Input Delay)**: By preventing long-running JavaScript operations
4. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: By setting image dimensions

## Additional Recommendations

For even better performance, consider:

1. **Image Format Optimization**:
   - Convert images to WebP format with JPEG fallback for older browsers
   - Further compress images (target ~100KB per gallery thumbnail)

2. **CDN Implementation**:
   - Host images on a CDN for faster delivery
   - Consider using a service like Cloudinary or Imgix for on-the-fly image optimization

3. **Server-Side Optimizations**:
   - Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
   - Set proper cache headers
   - Enable GZIP or Brotli compression

4. **Code Splitting**:
   - Break JavaScript into smaller chunks that only load when needed
   - Consider using import() for non-critical functionality

5. **Prefetching Based on User Behavior**:
   - Track which collections users commonly view
   - Prefetch those collections' images first

## How to Test Results

Monitor your improvements using:

1. Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools (re-run the test)
2. WebPageTest.org (for detailed waterfall analysis)
3. Google PageSpeed Insights (for field data)

The goal is to achieve:
- Performance score > 90
- First Contentful Paint < 1.2s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
